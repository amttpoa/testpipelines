            <div class="mb-4">
                We can eliminate both of those costs by sending instructor(s) to you rather than sending students to us. This allows your agency to potentially put more people through the training.

            <div class="mb-4">
                Possibly the most critical part of the planning process for any training course is securing a location conducive to the events requirements.
